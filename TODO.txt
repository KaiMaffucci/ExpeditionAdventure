    --- TODO ---

Future features:

 - make it so that the player cannot survive for long in a glacier or hot biome without protection

 - saving a world and reopening it

 - add special skills for player that are gained when a player finds a "mystic object" or something

 - a lot will have to be added alongside this to be able to make it work, like an in-game selection screen using IJKL and another button to select and one to go back

 - a feature that when you press a key it pauses the game and displays the world map until you unpause

 - add feature where you can press a key and get info on whatever tile you are on and what is on it

 - make it generate structures, like bodies of water
 
    and abandoned shacks where you cannot pass through the walls

 - add enemies of some kind
 - other NPCs of some sort
 - being able to interact with the environment
 Ideas:

    1. Evil beings that will make you respawn and lose all your items, but they move very slowly and in a specific region, like in the evil biome

 - add weather (probably a new file for it)

    1. Rain & lightning

    2. Snow

    3. windy storm that kind of pushes you around

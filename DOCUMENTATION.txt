HEADER FILE CONSTANTS:

	DELAY: used for making a short delay, like in between ticks.
 
	LONGDELAY: used to make a REALLY long delay

	Any kind of constant that ends with "_CLR" is a color pair constant for ncurses color pairs.
 
	MIN_SELECT_Y: minimum y value for the select screen cursor

	MAX_SELECT_Y: max  imum y value for the select screen cursor

	MIN_PLR_X: minimum x value allowed for the player on the coordinate plane.
 
	MAX_PLR_X: maximunm x value allowed for the player on the coordinate plane.
 
	MIN_PLR_Y: minimum y value allowed for the player on the coordinate plane.
 
	MAX_PLR_Y: maximum y value allowed for the player on the coordinate plane.
 
	BIOME_COUNT: the number of biomes that are used in random generation, NOT including glacier biome


HEADER FILE STRUCTS:

	Map: is the typedef struct for map making. Contains the biome and the actual array map itself as members.


FUNCTIONS WITH PROTOTYPE IN HEADER:

	void movplr(int *x, int *y);

		checks the keyboard for input and moves the player appropriatley. Takes the player's coordinate x and y values memory addresses as parameters.

	void genMap(Map *mapin, char biomein);

		generates a map with the given map array. Parameters are the memory address of the map and then the biome you would like to have the map generate.
 
	void printMap(Map *mapin);

		prints a map on the screen. Parameter is the memory address of the map you would like to print.
  
	void displayBorders();

		prints the text borders on the screen and thats it.
 
	void tileDescription();

		prints the description of the tile that the player is currently on


MAIN LOCAL VARIABLES & ARRAYS:

	plrx & plry: the coords for the player.
 
	r: for generating random int

	i: for loops

	r: for random values

	gen_biome: used to choose which biome to generate the map as.

	Maps: is an array of data type Map, contains every map in the game.
 
	biomes: array of all of the biomes used in random generation.
 
	ch: used for getting user input as a character

	playing: used to determine if the player is alive/playing still, used like a boolean

	start_screen_enter_pressed: used like a boolean to store if enter is pressed on the start screen

	current_world_map_x & current_world_map_y: stores the coords of which chunk/small map is being displayed
